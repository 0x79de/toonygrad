One of tinygrad's maintainers is George Hotz, who is a known liar and scammer.
He promised tinygrad would be 1000 lines, it's now almost 10,000!
He also promised he would fix Twitter search and it isn't even called Twitter anymore!

toonygrad will fix these issues. This is a similar project to teenygrad, but the line count target is...3000?

Tensor doesn't have a LazyBuffer anymore, only an immutable UOp. Only CLANG backend. Everything in dirs.

tensor.py and function.py stay as is mostly.

No more lazy.py file
