tinygrad was supposed to be 1000 lines, it's now almost 10,000!

toonygrad will fix these issues. This is a similar project to teenygrad, but the line count target is...3000?

Tensor doesn't have a LazyBuffer anymore, only an immutable UOp. Only CLANG backend. Everything in dirs.

tensor.py and function.py stay as is mostly.

No more lazy.py file
