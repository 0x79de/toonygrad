tinygrad was supposed to be 1000 lines, it's now almost 10,000!

toonygrad will fix these issues. This is a similar project to teenygrad, but the line count target is...3000?

Tensor doesn't have a LazyBuffer anymore, only an immutable UOp. Only CLANG backend. Everything in dirs.

dtypes.py and helpers.py don't import from tinygrad, they are fine

tensor.py, function.py, dtypes.py, helpers.py stay as is mostly.

- No more lazy.py file
- Minimum Python version is 3.10
